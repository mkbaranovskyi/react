## Intro

### Install & Run

Client (if you need):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/redux@latest/dist/redux.min.js"></script>
```

Server:

```bash
# Option 1: Quick start
npx create-react-app test --template redux
# OR with TypeScript
npx create-react-app test --template redux-typescript

# Option 2: Add Redux to the existing React project:
npm i redux react-redux @types/react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit redux-typescript
```

For React, you have to wrap your root React component with the `<Provider>` component from React-Redux:

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

***

### Redux DevTools

If you use `@reduxjs/toolkit`, you already have it installed.

Otherwise:

1. Install the Redux DevTools [browser extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#installation) and change your code to activate it for your local app. 
2. `npm i redux-devtools-extension`
3. 
```js
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension'

const store = createStore(
	rootReducer,
	composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk, logger))
)
```

***

### Redux Toolkit 

If you used the Redux template (Option 1), Redux ToolKit is already installed. Otherwise, type:

```bash
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit
```

Redux Toolkit is the recommended way to build production apps with Redux.

It provides a number of useful [functions](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started#whats-included):

- `configureStore` is a nice wrapper for `createStore`
- `createReducer` is a good alternative to `switch/case`
- `createAction`
- etc.

***

### Basics 

Redux is a container managing the **global State** of your app. 

It can be used with any framework or without any.

It usually consists of these elements:

- `state` is an object holding some important info about your app
- `store` is a storage for your State
- `action` is an object describing changes to the State
- `action creator` is a function creating Actions
- `reducer` is a function that performs changes to the State, acts like an *event listener* which reacts to the Action it's interested in

Use cases:

1. You have several States in your app
2. The app State is needed in many places of your app
3. The State update logic is complex
5. You need some degree of abstraction for a large app with many devs on it.

#### Bank analogy

Bank is a Store holding the clients' money (States). You go to the bank to withdraw some of your money. But you don't take the money from the storage yourself - you go to a cashier or ATM (Reducer) and perform one of the standard requests (Actions): "WITHDRAW_MONEY". The cashier (Reducer) receives your request (Action), gives you the money and changes your balance (State) to a lower number.

***


## Core Components

### State

A plain JS object with any number of fields.

Not every State in the app should live in Redux - components may have their own inner state that is only used by them.

***

### Store

A container holding the app's global State.

You can only have **a single Store** in your app.

There're 2 ways to create Store:

1. Vanilla Redux `createStore`
2. Redux ToolKit `configureStore` with some extra options

```js
// Option 1
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import rootReducer from './reducer'

let preloadedState
const persistedTodosString = localStorage.getItem('todos')

if (persistedTodosString) {
  preloadedState = {
    todos: JSON.parse(persistedTodosString)
  }
}

export const store = createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState)

// Option 2
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import rootReducer from '../reducer'

let preloadedState
const persistedTodosString = localStorage.getItem('todos')

if (persistedTodosString) {
	preloadedState = {
		todos: JSON.parse(persistedTodosString)
	}
}

export const store = configureStore({
	reducer: rootReducer,
	preloadedState
})
```

***

**Never directly change the State inside the Store.**

To change the State:

1. create an **Action object** describing the changes, and **dispatch** it to the Store
2. when the Action is dispatched, the Store runs the root **Reducer function** which **calculates the new State** based on the old State and the Action
3. the Store **notifies subscribers** about the State updates so they can render the changes

***

#### Methods

- `dispatch(action)` - This method is **the only way to update the State**. It makes the Store run its Reducer to update the State.
- `getState()` - Returns the current State.
- `subscribe(cb)` - `cb` will be called each time the State is updated. Returns the `unsubscribe` function that can be called to unregister listeners. 

***

A simplified Store inside looks like this:

```js
function createStore(reducer, preloadedState) {
  let state = preloadedState
  const listeners = []

  function getState() {
    return state
  }

  function subscribe(listener) {
    listeners.push(listener)
    return function unsubscribe() {
      const index = listeners.indexOf(listener)
      listeners.splice(index, 1)
    }
  }

  function dispatch(action) {
    state = reducer(state, action)
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener())
  }

  dispatch({ type: '@@redux/INIT' })

  return { dispatch, subscribe, getState }
}
```

***

#### Enhancers

A wrapper for the Store changing the way it behaves.

Example enhancers:

```ts
// This enhancer logs 'Hi' to the console on each `dispatch`
const logEnhancer =
	(createStore: Function): any =>
	(rootReducer: Function, preloadedState: Object, enhancers: Function[]) => {
		const store = createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancers)

		function newDispatch(action: Action) {
			// Mandatory - Dispatch the Action the usual way
			const result = store.dispatch(action)
			// New feature: log the update State 
			console.log(store.getState())
			// Mandatory - the usual return vslue
			return result
		}

		return { ...store, dispatch: newDispatch }
	}

// This enhancer adds `{ meaningOfLife: 42 }` with each `getState()` response
export const includeMeaningOfLife = (createStore) => (rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancers) => {
	const store = createStore(rootReducer, preloadedState, enhancers)

	function newGetState() {
		return {
			// Get results from the Store the usual way
			...store.getState(),
			// And add new features
			meaningOfLife: 42,
		}
	}

	return { ...store, getState: newGetState }
}
```

Using enhancers:

```js
// createStore
import { createStore, compose } from 'redux'
import rootReducer from './reducer'
import {sayHiOnDispatch, includeMeaningOfLife } from './exampleAddons/enhancers'

// Option 1: 
const composedEnhancer = compose(sayHiOnDispatch, includeMeaningOfLife)
const store = createStore(rootReducer, undefined, composedEnhancer)

// Option 2:
export const store = configureStore({
	reducer: rootReducer,
	preloadedState,
	enhancers: [sayHiOnDispatch, includeMeaningOfLife]
})
```

***

### Reducer

A function that returns the new State (or the old one if nothing has changed).

```js
const reducer = (state, action) => {
	// Inspect `action.type` and return the updated state
	// Otherwise - return the previous state
	return state
}
```

Reducer is a **pure function**, it accepts `(currentState, action)` as parameters and calculates the new State using these parameters only. 

Never modify the existing State, only make **immutable updates** by copying the existing State, changing and returning the copy. You must make a copy of **every** level of nesting that needs to be updated, Redux ToolKit helps writing the update logic.

`createStore` accepts only one Reducer, so if we have several Reducers, we have to unite them into a single `rootReducer`.

***

### Action & Action Creator

An object telling the Store how to update State. Like the State data, Action should contain the smallest amount of information needed to describe what happened.

Properties:

- `type: string`
- `payload?: any`

**Action Creator** - a function encapsulating the process of creating an Action object. 

Action Creators is **the preferred way** of dispatching Actions. 

The simplest Action Creators just return the Action object.

```js
// Instead of 
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incrementBy', payload: 10 })
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/incrementBy', payload: 5 })

// you can do
const incrementBy = (num) => ({ type: 'incrementBy', payload: num })

store.dispatch(incrementBy(10))
store.dispatch(incrementBy(5))
```

More complex ones can 

***

### Example interaction

```js
// === Store ===
const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer)
// or the better way
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer })

// === State ===
const initialState = {
	value: 0
}

// === Reducer ===
function counterReducer(state = initialState, action){
	switch(action.type){
		case 'counter/increment':
			return {...state, value: state.value + 1}
		case 'counter/decrement':
			return {...state, value: state.value - 1}
		default:
			return state
	}
}

// === Action ===
const action = {
	type: 'counter/decrement'
}

// Chenge the state
store.dispatch(action)
```

***


## Main Concepts

### Immutability

State updates in Redux are **immutable**. 

You have to **make a copy** of the existing State object, modify and save it. **Modifying the existing object is not enough!**

```js
// In a Reducer...

// BAD
case 'counter/increment':
	state.value++

// GOOD
case 'counter/increment':
	return { ...state, value: state.value + 1 }
```

***

### Data Flow

Redux uses a "one-way data flow" app structure.

![](img/2021-05-03-18-56-53.png)

Basic idea:

- State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
- The UI is rendered based on that State
- When something happens (such as user clicking a button), the State is updated based on what has happened
- The UI re-renders based on the new State

Redux in details:

- Initial setup:
  - A Store is created using a root Reducer function
  - The Store calls the root Reducer once, and saves the return value as its initial State
  - When the UI is first rendered, UI components access the current State of the Redux Store, and use that data to decide what to render. They also subscribe to any future Store updates so they can know if the State has changed.
- Updates:
  - Something happens in the app, such as user clicking a button
	- The app code dispatches an Action to the Redux Store, like `dispatch({ type: 'counter/incremented' })`
	- The Store runs the Reducer function again with the previous State and the current Action, and saves the return value as the new State
	- The Store notifies all parts of the UI that are subscribed that the Store has been updated
	- Each UI component that needs data from the Store checks to see if the parts of the State they need have changed
	- Each component that sees its data has changed, forces a re-render with the new data

Action dispatch in details:

1. Enhancers run
2. 1st middleware runs
3. 2nd middleware runs
4. ...
5. 2nd middleware finishes
6. 1st middleware finishes
7. `dispatch(action)` is actually called

***

### Splitting Reducers

Huge Reducers with complex logic handling a lot of Actions are hard to comprehend. That's why they are usually split into multiple smaller Reducer functions.

Reducer for a specific section of the Redux app State is called a **"slice reducer"**.

Its name typically starts with a feature name and then describes the event that happened (e.g. `todos/todoAdded`, `filters/statusFilterChanged`).

From the terrible nested logic like this:

`src/reducers.js`

```js
export default function appReducer(state = initialState, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'todos/todoAdded':
			return {
				...state,
				todos: [
					...state.todos,
					{
						id: nextTodoId(state.todos),
						text: action.payload,
						completed: false
					}
				]
			}
		case 'todos/todoToggled':
			return {
				...state,
					todos: state.todos.map((todo) => {
						if (todo.id !== action.payload) {
						return todo
					}

					return {
						...todo,
						completed: !todo.completed
					}
				})
			}
		case 'filters/statusFilterChanged':
			return {
				...state,
				filters: {
					...state.filters,
					status: action.payload
				}
			}
		default:
			return state
	}
}
```

To these consice specific Reducers: 

`src/features/todos/todosSlice.js`

```js
export default function todosReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'todos/todoAdded': {
      // Can return just a new todos array - no extra object around it
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: nextTodoId(state),
          text: action.payload,
          completed: false
        }
      ]
    }
    case 'todos/todoToggled': {
      return state.map(todo => {
        if (todo.id !== action.payload) {
          return todo
        }

        return {
          ...todo,
          completed: !todo.completed
        }
      })
    }
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

`src/features/todos/filtersSlice.js`

```js
const initialState = {
	status: 'All',
	colors: []
}

export default function filtersReducer(state = initialState, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'filters/statusFilterChanged': {
			return {
				// Again, one less level of nesting to copy
				...state,
				status: action.payload
			}
		}
		default:
			return state
	}
}
```

See the next chapter to find out how to combine these Reducers.

***

### Reducer composition

As the Store can only accept **a single** Reducer, we need to **combine** our two Reducers.

**NB**: Each of these Reducers is managing its own part of the global State. The State parameter is different for every Reducer, and corresponds to the part of the State it manages.

`src/reducer.js`

```js
import todosReducer from './features/counter/todos/todoSlice'
import filtersReducer from './features/filters/filterSlice'

export default function rootReducer(state = {}, action) {
	// always return a new object for the root State
	return {
		// the value of `state.todos` is whatever the todosReducer returns
		todos: todosReducer(state.todos, action),
		// For both Reducers, we only pass in their slice of the state
		filters: filtersReducer(state.filters, action)
	}
}
```

Or we can use `combineReducers()` method from `redux` to do it for us:

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import todosReducer from './features/counter/todos/todoSlice'
import filtersReducer from './features/filters/filterSlice'

export default combineReducers({
	todos: todosReducer,
	filters: filtersReducer
})
```

The key names you give to `combineReducers()` decide what the key names of your State object will be.

***

### Middleware

Redux [middleware](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#middleware) provides a third-party extension point **between** dispatching Action, and the moment it reaches the Reducer.

When we call `store.dispatch(action)`, we're actually calling **the first middleware in the pipeline**.

Unlike a reducer, **middleware can have side effects** inside.

Often used for side-effects:

- logging and crash reporting
- async actions (setting timers or making API calls)
- routing
- pausing or even stopping the Action

Redux middleware are written as a series of **three nested functions**.

Each middleware follows the template:

```js
const anotherExampleMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  // Do something in here, when each action is dispatched
  return next(action)
}
```

Example - logger:

```js
// The outer function is actually the middleware itself, it will be called once
function logger(storeAPI) {
	// This wrapper will be called once; `next(action)` will turn into `dispatch(action)` if this is the last middleware in the pipeline
	return function wrapDispatch(next) {
		// The inner function will be called on every action dispatch
		return function handleAction(action) {
			console.log('state: ', storeAPI.getState())
			console.log('action: ', action)
			return next(action)
		}
	}
}
```

Example - async code in case of some specific Action, a widespread usecase:

```js
const delayedMessageMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/todoAdded') {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Added a new todo: ', action.payload)
    }, 1000)
  }

  return next(action)
}
```

We use a special built-in enhancer `applyMiddleware()` to attach middleware to the chain.

```js
// Option 1:
import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux'
export const store = createStore(
	rootReducer, 
	0, // initial State
	applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)
)

// Option 2:
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
export const store = configureStore({
	reducer: rootReducer,
	middleware: [print1, print2, print3],
	preloadedState,
	enhancers: [sayHiOnDispatch, includeMeaningOfLife]
})
```

## `react-redux`

A UI binding lib that handles the store interaction logic, so you don't have to write that code yourself.

React Redux implements many performance optimizations internally, so that your own component only re-renders when it actually needs to.

### How to use

1. Create a Redux State Slice. If you use `createSlice` API from Redux Toolkit, you may use *"kinda mutable"* updates that will be transformed into correct **immutable** updates.

`features/counter/counterSlice.ts`

```ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const counterSlice = createSlice({
	name: 'counter',
	initialState: {
		value: 0
	},
	reducers: {
		// You might need to return or stop returning the changed State sometimes
		increment: (state) => ++state,
		decrement: (state) => --state,
		incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
			return state.value += action.payload
		}
	}
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

2. Create a Store and add Slice Reducers to it

`app.store.ts`

```ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import counterSlice from '../features/counter/counterSlice'

export default configureStore({
	reducer: {
		counter: counterSlice
	}
})
```

3. Wrap your App in `<Provider store={store} />`

`index.ts`

```ts
import store from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

4. Use React Redux hooks to interact with the Store:
   1. `useSelector` reads data from the Store
   2. `useDispatch` dispatches actions

```ts
export const Counter: React.FC = () => {
	const count = useSelector((state: any) => state.counter.value)
	const dispatch = useDispatch()

	return (
		<div>
			<div>
				<button
					aria-label="Increment value"
					onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
				>
					Increment
				</button>
				<span>{count}</span>
				<button
					aria-label="Decrement value"
					onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
				>
					Decrement
				</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

***

### Hooks

1. [Docs](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks)

There're 3 Redux hooks:

1. `useDispatch`
2. `useSelector`
3. `useStore`

***

`useDispatch` returns a reference to the `dispatch` function from the Redux store.

***

`useSelector`: 

- Receives the Redux State as a parameter
- Returns a specific part of that State
- Subscribes to it (the component will be re-rendered when it changes).

Features:

- Similar to `mapStateToProps` of `connect` but uses strict comparison by default (`===`). This can be changed using the 2nd optional parameter.
- The selector function must be **pure**.
- Will run whenever the function component renders (unless its reference hasn't changed since a previous render and a cached result can be returned)
- Will **subscribe** to the Store and run your selector whenever an Action is dispatched
- Using `useSelector` multiple times within the same fomponent creates **multiple subscriptions**. A dispatched Action should result in a **single re-render** in this case.

More complex selectors (with multiple fields) can be created using `{ createSelector } from reselect` (see the docs).

**Warning**: There-re also some edge cases that may result in unexpected errors, [see the docs](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#usage-warnings).

***

`useStore` returns s reference to the same Redux Store that was passed to the `<Provider store={store}>` component. 

Rarely used.

***

**Example**: `Counter.tsx`

```ts
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { decrement, increment, } from './counterSlice'

export const Counter: React.FC = () => {
	const count = useSelector((state: any) => state.counter.value)
	const dispatch = useDispatch()

	return (
		<div className="counterContainer">
			<h2>Counter</h2>
			<strong>{count}</strong>
			<button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
			<button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

***

### `connect`

HOC that connects the Store data with components. 

It's mostly replaced by Hooks now. It's only here for reference. 

`connect` accepts 2 optional parameters:

- [0]: `mapStateToProps: Function` provides your Component with a piece of Redux State
- [1]: `mapDispatchToProps: Function` provides your Component with a function(-s) to dispatch Actions to the Store. 

```js
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
const MyComponent = (props) => {
	// 3) `connect` HOC has filled your props with new parameters - get them
	const { todos, dispatch } = props

	// ALL 3 STEPS IS A FULL EQUIVALENT OF THE HOOKS:

	// const todos = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.todos)
	// const dispatch = useDispatch()
}

// 1) Define your `mapState` and `mapDispatch` functions if needed
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({ todos: state.todos })

// 2) Connect them to your Component
export default connect(mapStateToProps, null)(MyComponent)
```

***

#### `mapStateToProps`

A conventional name of the 1st argument for `connect`.

Features: 

- **Shoud be fast** as it runs every time the State changes (also when Props change - if `ownProps` is used). 
- **Should be pure**

`connect` calls `store.getState()` after each Action is dispatched to decide whether to re-run `mapStateToProps` or not. 

- Accepts:
  - `state: RootState` - the Redux global State
  - `ownProps?: any` - the Component's own Props fall in here if they are needed. Don't add it if you don't need it because it adds an extra reason for `mapStateToProps` to run - when new Props arrive (even if they aren't used).
- Returns:
  - an `Object` with the needed pieces of the Redux State. This object will be merged into the connected component's Props. Your Component will be subscribed to the changes of these pieces of State when they are inserted. 

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state: RootState, ownProps?: any) => ({ todos: state.todos })

connect(mapStateToProps, null)(MyComponent)
```

See complete examples below.

There're some pitfalls (e.g. your Component might re-render too often) - see the [docs](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapstate#behavior-and-gotchas)

***

#### `mapDispatchToProps`

A conventional name of the 2nd argument for `connect`.

Features:

- If the 2nd parameter to `connect` **isn't provided**, your Component receives the usual `dispatch` function to its Props
- 

In all cases below, the Component will receive `dispatch` into Props:

```js
// 1
connect()(MyComponent)
// 2 
connect(null, null)(MyComponent)
// 3
connect(mapStateToProps)(MyComponent)
```



In fact, **the connected Component will receive `dispatch` even if it wasn't provided!**

```js
import React from 'react'
import { connect, ConnectedProps } from 'react-redux'
import { removeTodo, toggleTodo } from './todoSlice'
import { ITodo } from '../../types'

const TodoItem: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
	const { todo, index, dispatch } = props

	const classes: string[] = []
	if (todo.completed) {
		classes.push('completed')
	}

	return (
		<li className="todoItem">
			<span className={classes.join(' ')}>
				<input
					type="checkbox"
					onChange={() => dispatch(toggleTodo(todo.id))}
					checked={todo.completed}
				/>
				{index}) &nbsp;
				{todo.title}
			</span>
			<button
				className="removeButton"
				onClick={() => dispatch(removeTodo(todo.id))}
			>
				&times;
			</button>
		</li>
	)
}

const connector = connect()

type PropsFromRedux = ConnectedProps<typeof connector>
type Props = PropsFromRedux & {
	todo: ITodo
	index: number
}

export default connector(TodoItem)
```

***

### `thunk`

This middleware extends the Store abilities. It lets you write any **async logic** to interact with the Store.

You can write Action Creators that return a function instead of an Action.

```bash
npm i redux-thunk
```

`store.ts` - apply `thunk` middleware

```ts
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

const store = configureStore({
	reducer: {
		counter: counterSlice,
		todos: todoSlice
	},
	// The store now has the ability to accept thunk functions in `dispatch`
	middleware: [thunk]
})
```

`counterSlice.ts` - create your thunk functions following the template described above

```ts
const INCREMENT_COUNTER = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER'

// Classic sync Action Creator
export const increment = () => ({ type: INCREMENT_COUNTER })

// Async thunk Action Creator
export const asyncIncrement = (dispatch, getState) => {
	setTimeout(() => {
		dispatch(increment())
	}, 1000)
}

// Conditional thunk Action Creator
export const incrementIfOdd = () => (dispatch, getState) => {
	const { counter } = getState()
	if (counter % 2 === 0) return

`Counter.tsx`

```ts
import { asyncIncrement, incrementIfOdd } from './counterSlice'

export const Counter: React.FC = () => {
	return (
		// ...
		<button onClick={() => dispatch(asyncIncrement)}>Async increment (1s delay)</button>

		<button onClick={() => dispatch(incrementIfOdd())}>Increment if odd</button>
		// ...
	)
}

### Redux docs Todo [example](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers)

Plan:

- todos are the **app State**
- filtering values are the **UI State**
- ID, text, completed status and optional color are each **component's inner State**

Filtering options:

- the current "completed" filter value
- an array of the currently selected color categories

Example of State:

```js
const todoAppState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 0, text: 'Learn React', completed: true },
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux', completed: false, color: 'purple' },
    { id: 2, text: 'Build something fun!', completed: false, color: 'blue' }
  ],
  filters: {
    status: 'Active',
    colors: ['red', 'blue']
  }
}
```

Next, we should think about Actions:

- add a new todo based on the entered text
- toggle the completed status of a todo
- select a color category for a todo
- delete a todo
- mark all todos as completed
- remove all completed todos
- choose a different "completed" filter
- choose a different color filter
- remove a color filter

Example of actions:

```js
{type: 'todos/todoAdded', payload: todoText}
{type: 'todos/todoToggled', payload: todoId}
{type: 'todos/colorSelected', payload: {todoId, color}}
{type: 'todos/todoDeleted', payload: todoId}
{type: 'todos/allCompleted'}
{type: 'todos/completedCleared'}
{type: 'filters/statusFilterChanged', payload: filterValue}
{type: 'filters/colorFilterChanged', payload: {color, changeType}}
```
